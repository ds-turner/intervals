\title{Group Overlapping Intervals}
\usage{
grp_ints(.data, .start, .end, ..., .gap = 0, .group_col = int_grp_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame or tibble containing the interval data.}

\item{.start}{The column name (unquoted) representing the start of the intervals.}

\item{.end}{The column name (unquoted) representing the end of the intervals.}

\item{...}{Additional columns to group by before identifying overlapping intervals.}

\item{.gap}{The maximum allowed gap between intervals for them to be considered overlapping.
Intervals are grouped if the start of one interval is less than or equal to
the end of the previous interval plus the gap.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the original data and an additional column \code{int_grp_id} indicating
the group ID for overlapping intervals.
}
\description{
This function groups overlapping intervals in a dataset based on start and end columns.
It assigns a unique group ID (\code{int_grp_id}) to each set of overlapping intervals.
Intervals are considered overlapping if the start of one interval is within the gap
threshold of the end of another interval.

library(dplyr)
data <- tibble(
  id = 1:5,
  start = c(1, 2, 5, 10, 12),
  end = c(3, 4, 7, 11, 14)

# Group intervals with a gap of 1
grp_ints(data, start, end, .gap = 1)
