\title{Trim Intervals Based on Overlaps}
\usage{
trm_ints(x, y, .x_start, .x_end, .y_start, .y_end, ..., order = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame or tibble containing the primary intervals to be trimmed.}

\item{y}{A data frame or tibble containing the intervals used to trim \code{x}.}

\item{.x_start}{The column name in \code{x} representing the start of the intervals.}

\item{.x_end}{The column name in \code{x} representing the end of the intervals.}

\item{.y_start}{The column name in \code{y} representing the start of the intervals.}

\item{.y_end}{The column name in \code{y} representing the end of the intervals.}

\item{...}{Additional columns to group by when calculating overlaps and trimming intervals.}

\item{order}{A logical value indicating whether to order the resulting intervals by start and end points.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame or tibble containing the trimmed intervals from \code{x}, with columns for start, end,
and any grouping variables.
}
\description{
The \code{trm_ints} function trims intervals in dataset \code{x} based on overlaps with intervals in dataset \code{y}.
It splits intervals in \code{x} at the boundaries of overlaps with \code{y}, removes unwanted intervals, and
returns the resulting intervals. Optionally, the output can be ordered by start and end points.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The function identifies overlaps between intervals in \code{x} and \code{y} using the \code{get_overlaps} helper function.
\item It calculates split points at the boundaries of overlapping intervals using the \code{get_split_points} helper function.
\item The intervals in \code{x} are split at these points using the \code{split_ints} helper function.
\item Unwanted intervals (those overlapping with \code{y}) are removed using the \code{rm_ints} helper function.
\item If \code{order = TRUE}, the resulting intervals are ordered by start and end points.
