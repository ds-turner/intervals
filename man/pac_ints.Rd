\title{Merge (pack) Overlapping Intervals}
\usage{
pac_ints(.data, .start, .end, ..., .gap = 0, .group_col = int_grp_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing the interval data.}

\item{.start}{The column name (unquoted) representing the start of the intervals.}

\item{.end}{The column name (unquoted) representing the end of the intervals.}

\item{...}{Additional columns to group by before identifying and packing intervals.}

\item{.gap}{The maximum allowed gap between intervals for them to be considered overlapping.
Intervals are grouped if the start of one interval is less than or equal to
the end of the previous interval plus the gap.}

\item{.group_col}{The name of the column to store the group IDs (default: \code{int_grp_id}).
This column is used to group overlapping intervals.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with the summarized intervals. Each row represents a packed interval,
with the minimum start value, maximum end value, the grouping columns and the \code{.group_id} column.
}
\description{
This function takes a dataset with intervals (defined by start and end columns) and groups
overlapping intervals using \code{grp_ints}. It then summarizes the intervals by collapsing
overlapping intervals into a single interval per group, with the minimum start and maximum end
values for each group.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
data <- data.frame(
  id = 1:5,
  start = c(1, 2, 5, 10, 12),
  end = c(3, 4, 7, 11, 14)
)

# Pack intervals with a gap of 1
pac_ints(data, start, end, .gap = 1)

# Pack intervals with a custom group column name
pac_ints(data, start, end, .gap = 1, .group_col = "group_id")
}
