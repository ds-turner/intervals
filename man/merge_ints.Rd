\title{Merge Overlapping Intervals}
\usage{
merge_ints(.data, .start, .end, ..., .gap = 1, .group_col = int_grp_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing the interval data.}

\item{.start}{The column name (unquoted) representing the start of the ints.}

\item{.end}{The column name (unquoted) representing the end of the ints.}

\item{...}{Additional columns to group by before identifying and merging ints.}

\item{.gap}{The maximum allowed gap between ints for them to be considered overlapping.
Intervals are grouped if the start of one interval is less than or equal to
the end of the previous interval plus the gap.}

\item{.group_col}{The name of the column to store the group IDs (default: \code{int_grp_id}).
This column is used to group overlapping ints.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with the summarized ints. Each row represents a packed interval,
with the minimum start value, maximum end value, the grouping columns and the \code{.group_id} column.
}
\description{
This function takes a dataset with ints (defined by start and end columns) and groups
overlapping ints using \code{grp_ints}. It then summarizes the ints by collapsing
overlapping ints into a single interval per group, with the minimum start and maximum end
values for each group.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
data <- data.frame(
  id = 1:5,
  start = c(1, 2, 5, 10, 12),
  end = c(3, 4, 7, 11, 14)
)

# Merge ints with a gap of 1
merge_ints(data, start, end, .gap = 1)

# Merge ints with a custom group column name
merge_ints(data, start, end, .gap = 1, .group_col = "group_id")
}
