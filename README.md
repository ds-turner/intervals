# intervals

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of intervals is to help users work with intervals, particular
cleaning them. It groups and merges overlapping intervals as well as
allowing the user to remove parts of one set of intervals, based on
another.

## Installation

You can install the development version of intervals from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ds-turner/intervals")
```
