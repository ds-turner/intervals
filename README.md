# intervals

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`{intervals}` helps users tidy up messy intervals. It can group and
merge overlapping intervals as well as remove parts of one set of
intervals, based on another set of intervals. In this context an
interval is defined as having a start and a stop. It can be numeric or
date type.

{intervals} is mostly written in
[`{data.table}`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) for memory
efficiency, it will always return a `data.table` object.

## Installation

You can install the development version of intervals from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ds-turner/intervals")
```

## Useage

``` r
library(intervals)
# library(data.table)
```

### Grouping and Packing Intervals

``` r

 ints <- data.frame(
    id = c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B"),
    st = c(1, 2, 5, 10, 12, 14),
    end = c(3, 4, 7, 11, 14, 16)
  )
 ints
#>   id st end
#> 1  A  1   3
#> 2  A  2   4
#> 3  A  5   7
#> 4  B 10  11
#> 5  B 12  14
#> 6  B 14  16
```

`ints` is a set of overlapping intrevals. We can identify the
overlapping intervals and add an ID column `int_grp_id` for overlapping
groups.

``` r
grp_ints(ints, st, end, id)
#>        id    st   end int_grp_id
#>    <char> <num> <num>      <int>
#> 1:      A     1     3          1
#> 2:      A     2     4          1
#> 3:      A     5     7          1
#> 4:      B    10    11          2
#> 5:      B    12    14          2
#> 6:      B    14    16          2
```

We can also merge the overlapping intervels into single intervals.

``` r
pac_ints(ints, st, end, id)
#>        id int_grp_id    st   end
#>    <char>      <int> <num> <num>
#> 1:      A          1     1     4
#> 2:      A          2     5     7
#> 3:      B          3    10    11
#> 4:      B          4    12    16
```

### Triming Intervals

You can remove parts of intervals based on another set of intervals.

``` r
pats <- 7

x <- data.frame(
  id = c(1:pats),
  start = rep(5, pats),
  end = rep(20, pats)
)

y <- data.frame(
  id = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7),
  start = c(10, 4, 4, 19, 4, 10, 19, 4, 9, 14, 19, 7, 9, 11, 13),
  end = c(15, 21, 6, 21, 6, 15, 21, 6, 11, 16, 21, 8, 10, 12, 18)
)
```

Here we will remove the parts of the intervals in x that overlap with
the intervals in y.

``` r
trm_ints(x, y, start, end, start, end, id)
#>        id start   end
#>     <int> <num> <num>
#>  1:     1     5    10
#>  2:     1    15    20
#>  3:     3     6    20
#>  4:     4     5    19
#>  5:     5     6    10
#>  6:     5    15    19
#>  7:     6     6     9
#>  8:     6    11    14
#>  9:     6    16    19
#> 10:     7     5     7
#> 11:     7     8     9
#> 12:     7    10    11
#> 13:     7    12    13
#> 14:     7    18    20
```

### Negative Intervals

``` r
ints <- data.frame(
  id = c("a", "a", "a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "c",   "c", "c", "c", "d"),
  start = c(1, 4, 10, 18, 23, 7, 12, 1, 7, 12, 23, 10),
  end = c(3, 7, 15, 21, 25, 9, 16, 3, 9, 16, 25, 15),
  index = c(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5),
  study_end = c(20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20)
)
ints
#>    id start end index study_end
#> 1   a     1   3     5        20
#> 2   a     4   7     5        20
#> 3   a    10  15     5        20
#> 4   a    18  21     5        20
#> 5   a    23  25     5        20
#> 6   b     7   9     5        20
#> 7   b    12  16     5        20
#> 8   c     1   3     5        20
#> 9   c     7   9     5        20
#> 10  c    12  16     5        20
#> 11  c    23  25     5        20
#> 12  d    10  15     5        20
```

We can also create a set of intervals that represent the gaps between
the given intervals.

``` r
neg_ints(ints, start, end, id)
#>        id start   end
#>    <char> <num> <num>
#> 1:      a     8     9
#> 2:      a    16    17
#> 3:      a    22    22
#> 4:      b    10    11
#> 5:      c     4     6
#> 6:      c    10    11
#> 7:      c    17    22
```

These intervals can have an upper and lower bounds if required

``` r
neg_ints(ints, start, end, id, .lower = index, .upper = study_end)
#>         id start   end index study_end
#>     <char> <num> <num> <num>     <num>
#>  1:      a     8     9     5        20
#>  2:      a    16    17     5        20
#>  3:      b     5     6     5        20
#>  4:      b    10    11     5        20
#>  5:      b    17    20     5        20
#>  6:      c     4     6     5        20
#>  7:      c    10    11     5        20
#>  8:      c    17    22     5        20
#>  9:      d     5     9     5        20
#> 10:      d    16    20     5        20
```

### 

We have been given the below treatment data. Each patient has a period
monthly treatment for the duration of 2023. For our analysis we will
consider the different dose frequencies as mutually exclusive and
higharical, i.e.Â a patient will not be considered as being dosed weekly
if there is a record of daily dosing and a patient will not be
considered as being dosed monthly if there is a record of weekly dosing.

``` r
trt <- data.frame(
  pat_id = c(1, 1, 1, 1,
             2, 2, 2
             ),
  trt_start_date = as.Date(c(
    "2023-07-13", "2023-06-05", "2023-07-01", "2023-01-01",
    "2023-03-02", "2023-03-05", "2023-01-01"
  )),
  trt_end_date = as.Date(c(
    "2023-07-20", "2023-08-15", "2023-10-13", "2023-12-31",
    "2023-03-10", "2023-03-15", "2023-12-31"
  )),
  dose_freq = c(
    "daily", "weekly",  "monthly", "monthly",
    "daily", "weekly", "monthly"
  )
)

trt
#>   pat_id trt_start_date trt_end_date dose_freq
#> 1      1     2023-07-13   2023-07-20     daily
#> 2      1     2023-06-05   2023-08-15    weekly
#> 3      1     2023-07-01   2023-10-13   monthly
#> 4      1     2023-01-01   2023-12-31   monthly
#> 5      2     2023-03-02   2023-03-10     daily
#> 6      2     2023-03-05   2023-03-15    weekly
#> 7      2     2023-01-01   2023-12-31   monthly
```

we can see that there is some overlapping so first we will merge the
overlapping intervals together and tidy up a bit

``` r
trt <- pac_ints(trt, trt_start_date, trt_end_date, pat_id, dose_freq, .gap = 1)
trt[, int_grp_id := NULL] # drop the grouping ID from `pac_ints`
setorder(trt, pat_id, trt_start_date) # order for ease of review
trt
#>    pat_id dose_freq trt_start_date trt_end_date
#>     <num>    <char>         <Date>       <Date>
#> 1:      1   monthly     2023-01-01   2023-12-31
#> 2:      1    weekly     2023-06-05   2023-08-15
#> 3:      1     daily     2023-07-13   2023-07-20
#> 4:      2   monthly     2023-01-01   2023-12-31
#> 5:      2     daily     2023-03-02   2023-03-10
#> 6:      2    weekly     2023-03-05   2023-03-15
class(trt)
#> [1] "data.table" "data.frame"
```

Then we can split up the intervals to make sure everything is mutually
exclusive

``` r
daily <- trt[dose_freq == "daily"]
weekly <- trt[dose_freq == "weekly"]
monthly <- trt[dose_freq == "monthly"]
# # remove the parts of the week dosing periods that overlap with the daily dosing intervals
# weekly <- trm_ints(
#   weekly,
#   daily,
#   trt_start_date,
#   trt_end_date,
#   trt_start_date,
#   trt_end_date,
#   pat_id,
#   .gap = 1
#   )
# # remove the parts of the monthly dosing periods that overlap with the daily and weelky dosing intervals
# monthly <- trm_ints(
#   monthly, 
#   rbind(daily, weekly), 
#   trt_start_date, 
#   trt_end_date, 
#   trt_start_date, 
#   trt_end_date, 
#   pat_id, 
#   .gap = 1
#   )
# 
# trt2 <- rbindlist(
#   list(
#     trt[dose_freq == "daily"], 
#     weekly,
#     monthly
#   )
# )
# setorder(trt2, pat_id, trt_start_date)
# 
# trt2
```
