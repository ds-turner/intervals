# intervals

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of intervals is to help users work with intervals, particular cleaning them.  It groups and merges overlapping intervals as well as allowing the user to remove parts of one set of intervals, based on another.

## Installation

You can install the development version of intervals from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ds-turner/intervals")
```
